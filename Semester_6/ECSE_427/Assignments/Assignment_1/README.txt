Instructions
============
1.Run the make file: make -f makefile
2.Run the executable generated by the makefile: ./my-test

What Works?
===========
I have implemented all of the methods that were specified in the the assignment 
specifications. Furthermore, I'm getting the same output as the expected test 
output so everything works.

Implementation Details
======================
The creation of threads is fairly straight forward. For the preemption, the 
way I did it is as follows. I created a timer that will trigger a signal every 
quantum micro seconds. When this signal is raised, I call my scheduler() function
to preempt the currently running thread with the next thread that is waiting in the 
queue. Although the threads are constantly being preempted, there will only be 
one thread that is actually running inside the handler() function (in my-test.c) 
as you need a lock. The other threads will call the semaphore_wait() function
and be put into the waitqueue for the given semaphore. When the thread with the 
lock has released it, my semaphore_signal() method will get the first thread in 
the wait queue for the given semaphore and put it in the runqueue. This thread 
will then execute the handler() function and so on. This coninues until all the 
threads haven't exited. The last thing I do is print the statistics. The major 
challenge that I faced while doing this assignment was debugging. It was hard to 
debug with gdb as there was constant thread switching taking place.

Final Output 
============
Below is the information printed when the my-test program is run.
I ran it numerous times and it always gave counter = 50 and result = 151402.656521.
